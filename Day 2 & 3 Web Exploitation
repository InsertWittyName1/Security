mysql >> get into the sql shell
show databases; >> shows all databases
show tables from session; >> shows the tables in session

select id from user where name='admin'; >> grabs id field from user table where name field is admin
select * from user where name='tom' OR 1=1; >> grabs all fields because 1=1 is always true

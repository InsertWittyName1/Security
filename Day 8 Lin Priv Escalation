sudo -l as soon as you get on box, tells me what i can run using sudo

cat /etc/sudoers to show who can sudo, and what they can sudo

apt-get can be used with GTFO Bins to escalate priveleges: https://gtfobins.github.io/

if suid bit is set, file runs as if you are owner, sgid is the same, but for groups.
find / -type f -perm /4000 -ls 2>/dev/null to find files with suid bit on, change 4000 to 2000 for sgid bit, and 6000 for either

find . -exec <command> if suid bit for find is set, would let you run commands as root

if there's a . at the beginning of $PATH, it checks current directory. We can change that using
